# 📸 Instagram Caption Generator

This project provides a mood-based Instagram caption assistant using both a Machine Learning (ML) recommender and a Large Language Model (LLM) via Hugging Face's API. The app is built using **Streamlit**.

---

## 🚀 Features

### ✨ LLM-Based Caption Generator

Generates creative Instagram captions using the Hugging Face `Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct` model based on image descriptions and selected moods.

### 🔍 ML-Based Caption Recommender

Recommends captions using **TF-IDF** vectorization and **cosine similarity** from a curated mood-tagged caption dataset.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Agile_Project_SEE.git
cd Agile_Project_SEE

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Hugging Face API token:

```env
HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token_here
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Streamlit App

If you have an app file (e.g., `app.py`), run:

```bash
